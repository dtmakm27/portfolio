You find yourself in your first year of a programming course. Lots of hours sitting? Feeling tired all the time? Bad posture? Joint pain? Death?! 

All these things go hand in hand (well except the last one). Sitting for extended periods of time without any kind of exercise will lead do body dysfunction. This is due to the fact that your body was not designed 4 so much sitting. You from an evolutionary perspective are supposed to be running around and doing physical activities throughout your day. The effect of sitting for extended periods of time can lead up to spinal defamation specifically anterior pelvic tilt. This is seen in most blue-collar workers who neglect exercise. Basically, your spine is deformed into an S shape which ruins your posture, which physical exercises harder on your body. Having bad posture also contributes to lack of confidence and motivation. Ok but how do we battle this when we must do a lot of work on computers?

I found the best solution is to do sports. I am personally interested in martial arts and have been for a lot of time. This has protected my back and my spine from all the work I do while sitting. 

Another way you should handle this is working in a variety of positions. Variate from working sitting down to standing up in intervals. 

Protecting your back for a happy and physically able future is a must! So, think now and reap the rewards later.
