One of the best ways to expand your mind is to learn a new language. If you think about it, you are learning a new way of thinking, literally. What better place to expand your mind than University? I always wanted to learn Japanese so when I heard about the free language courses I was bent on going.

The most significant element of that course was showing me that learning languages can be fun and that it is really enriching for you as a person. Later in the course when we started formulating sentences and learning, the structure of the language it gave me a new viewpoint of communication. Rather than sharing words in some languages you can share ideas of objects and meanings directly. Previously something like that sounded like telekinesis but actually, symbolic languages have that advantage over phonetic ones. Through my studying, I had experienced new ideas of how the mind works which only broadened my horizons. 

*Having been part of the course I now realize that communication is not only restricted to one form. Many cultures have a different way of expressing themselves through their language and that is just a reflection of their way of thinking, culture and way of life. I know realise that learning languages is a way of becoming a multicultural person and itâ€™s not only knowing the language but also experiencing the values of that specific culture. I will continue studying the language and as a next step, after I get to a certain level in Japanese I will start studying another language alongside that.*
