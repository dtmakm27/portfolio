In my opinion one of the most useful enterprising skills to have is good organisation and prioritizing. If you can manage your priorities well you can fit a lot into your day and you donâ€™t get so stressed, because you can achieve so much! 

The best place to fine tune this skill is university. There you have to juggle many activities at the same time and still manage to pull through. The main activities I had to manage at university this semester were studying, kickbox training, start-up courses, learning Japanese, volunteering, band rehearsals, and studying philosophy. Sounds like a lot.

Dealing with so many activities throughout this semester I learned a couple of things. For me the most significant was learning to prioritize. Studying for my course was my main goal, so it made sense to skip everything that interfered with it. At first I knew I was doing a lot of different activities but I still wanted to be a perfectionist and continue working on each one without giving myself any leeway. I soon realised I was just draining myself. I wanted to do everything and I was spread too thin. Then one day I finally saw that I was not concentrating enough on my studies. I decided to drop some of the activities that were interfering with my studying and then I dropped some other activities that were interfering with other more important ones. The result was, I felt really enthusiastic about everything I did!
Having gone through that I now know that prioritising is key if you want a successful life at university or as a whole. Some things are just more worth it than others and you should know and prioritise your activities in accordance with your goals so you can have a fulfilling life where you do only the things that are important for yourself.
