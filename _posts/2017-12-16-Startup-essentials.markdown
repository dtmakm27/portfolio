One of the best things about university is that it is an enriching experience for a person full with loads of opportunities. You are sat down and fed information, you are given the choice to explore yourself and the world around you. 

One of those really enriching experiences for me was the startup essentials programme. I just heard about it randomly on the first days at uni, and decided to join in. The programme was a course consisting of 4 workshops on the different aspects of starting and running a business.

The course gave me the confidence and knowledge needed to start developing my ideas. For me the most important thing about the workshops was linking your idea with the real world. Initially I had really wrong ideas about how businesses functioned and how impossible creating a business was. This was because the lack of knowledge how the process of starting a business worked. 

The idea I went with for the workshops was a travel agency for my home country. It seemed really impossible at the start but little by little I gained the knowledge on how to develop marketing, testing, and brainstorming skills that would make my ideas achievable.

After going through the workshops I now feel confident that I can actually start developing my ideas into a reality. I have significantly developed my presenting, teamworking, and entrepreneurial skills. Because I do not yet have the knowledge about how travel agencies work or any of the other details my next step is to start learning the specifics of my project.
All in all the startup essentials programme was an enrichening experience and I would recommend it to every student!
